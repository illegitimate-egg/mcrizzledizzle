# Installing Extensions

Extensions are distributed as `rhai` files. As with all software that you install on your computer, it's important to make sure that you trust the program that you're running as they are quite powerful.

Extensions go into the auto-generated extension folder. Some official examples can be found in the [extensions](https://github.com/illegitimate-egg/mcrizzledizzle/tree/master/rte/extensions) folder on the repository:

- `fill.rhai` - A worldedit like fill command
- `ping-pong.rhai` - A very basic command, responds when you using /ping
- `utils.rhai` - A set of utilities used for development of the extension interface

To see what commands are available you can use the `/help` command. To see what extensions are installed and their versions you can use the `/extensions` command.

## Other extensions

There are some third-party extensions that are officially endorsed by mcrizzledizzle.
